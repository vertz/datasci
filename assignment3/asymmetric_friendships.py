"""
The relationship "friend" is often symmetric, meaning that if I am your friend, you are my friend. 
Implement a MapReduce algorithm to check whether this property holds. 
Generate a list of all non-symmetric friend relationships.

The input is a 2 element list: [personA, personB]
personA: Name of a person formatted as a string
personB: Name of one of personAâ€™s friends formatted as a string
This implies that personB is a friend of personA, but it does not imply that personA is a friend of personB.

The output should be the (person, friend) and (friend, person) tuples for each asymmetric friendship.
